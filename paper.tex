	\begin{abstract}
		This paper explores the conceptual design and feasibility of a bioengineered relay organ that serves as an adaptable interface between regenerating peripheral nerves and artificial devices. The system includes agnostic relay cells capable of synaptic specialization, spatially organized axonal convergence, and modular interfaces to synthetic components. We follow a unified biological path and explore multiple engineering strategies for the synthetic interface, with special focus on optical, electrical, and chemical transduction methods.

	\section{Introduction}
	
	Peripheral nerve injuries present a major clinical challenge, often leading to lasting motor, sensory, or autonomic deficits. While peripheral nerves have some regenerative capacity, spontaneous recovery is typically limited by misrouting, incomplete reinnervation, and functional mismatches between regenerating axons and their target tissues. Traditional surgical repairs, nerve grafts, and bioengineered conduits aim to bridge nerve gaps but often fail to achieve full functional restoration, particularly in cases of complex or proximal injuries.
	
	Parallel to this, neuroprosthetic technologies have advanced rapidly, providing synthetic interfaces that can replace or augment lost neural functions. However, interfacing these devices with living nerve tissue remains fundamentally limited by biological-electronic mismatches, instability at the interface, immune responses, and the inability of current systems to flexibly accommodate different types of regenerating neurons (motor, sensory, autonomic) without pre-sorting or manual rewiring.
	
	This paper explores the feasibility of a novel approach: the development of a \textit{bioengineered synaptic relay organ} designed to serve as an adaptable, living interface between regenerating nerves and synthetic devices. This engineered structure would encapsulate the terminal portions of severed nerves, provide a population of agnostic relay cells capable of forming synapses with any incoming axons, and allow these relay cells to specialize post-contact into appropriate postsynaptic types. On the synthetic side, the relay organ would incorporate modular interfaces to external devices, with multiple plausible strategies such as optical, electrical, or chemical transduction.
	
	The goal of this study is to map out the biological underpinnings, engineering requirements, and interface design strategies needed to assess the feasibility of such a system. While we will follow a unified biological pathway focusing on one plausible cell and tissue design, we will explore several competing or complementary approaches for interfacing with synthetic devices, comparing their relative advantages, challenges, and integration potential. By consolidating knowledge from neuroscience, tissue engineering, synthetic biology, and bioelectronic interface design, this paper aims to provide a foundation for future experimental and theoretical work toward developing next-generation neuroprosthetic relay systems.
